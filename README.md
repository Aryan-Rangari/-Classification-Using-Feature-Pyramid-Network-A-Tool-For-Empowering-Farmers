# 🌾 Rice Seed Classification using CNN & FPN

This project focuses on building a deep learning-based rice seed classification model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** enhanced by **Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)**. The model classifies rice seeds using both grayscale and RGB image datasets and is optimized for high accuracy and efficient feature extraction.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- ✅ Achieved **99% accuracy** on the Kaggle grayscale dataset
- ✅ Achieved **80% accuracy** on the custom RGB KAU dataset
- 📊 Used **CNN + FPN** architecture for improved feature extraction
- 🖼️ Trained on **75,000+ grayscale** and **1,800+ RGB** rice seed images
- 📈 Published in **ICCCNT 2025 IEEE Conference at IIT Indore**
